				<h2> About Me </h2>
                
                <p> I'm an aspiring Web Designer with knowledge in Developing too. Truth be told I'm not that good when it comes to coding but I'm willing to learn all I can. With that being said i accel in Designing. Photoshop and Illustrator has been my best friend since I had my first Computer. What I plan to learn in this class is how create more components i can use in my websites. I can design them easy but coding them is another thing.

				<h2> Login Headers </h2>
                <div class="image">
                <a href="components/Login Header.png">
                <img src="components/Login Header.png"
                alt="login" height="900" width="900" />
                </a>
                </div>
                
                <h3> What I hope to Learn </h3>
                <p> So I understand the concept of Login Headers but I have almost no idea how to create them. Drawing them out are easy but what i dont understand is how to create two different components that are attached to each other. When you have the login header it has two tabs, one to login and one to sign up. They both occupy the same space. This is the part I dont understand. How to code two things into the same space. </p>
                
                <h3> How this relates and how I will learn it </h3>
                <p> From what I can understand I will need to learn how to do this because its a very basic tool. Majority of websites that are created now or were updated to todays standard use tabs. What is attached to the tabs or what I will use them for is not imortant but how to create them is. I will study and use the resources available to me and learn how to code the component. </p>

				<h2> Photo Slideshow </h2>
                <div class="image">
                <a href="components/Photo Slideshow.png">
                <img src="components/Photo Slideshow.png"
                alt="slideshow" height="900" width="900" />
                </a>
                </div>
                
                <h3> What I hope to Learn </h3>
                <p> So Photo Slideshow menus are probably the hardest thing when it comes to css and html. I understand that its a <list> component but how to get them to move whether automatically or manually is still something that escapes me. </p>
                
                <h3> How this relates and how I will learn it </h3>
                <p> It relates because most websites nowadays use some form of slideshow. In a previous class i have taken, we explored a slideshow option, although it was just an extra credit assignment so I did not do it. Now i will go back and see if i can find the information on how to do it. </p>

				<h2> Footers </h2>
                <div class="image">
                <a href="components/Footers.png">
                <img src="components/Footers.png"
                alt="footer" height="900" width="900"/>
                </a>
                </div>
                
                <h3> What I hope to Learn </h3>
                <p> In previous classes I have studied how to create footers. While I grasp the concept I still have a few issues on how to create a good footer. Mine dont look bad but they dont look professional. The html is not the issue, its the CSS that i have to learn more about. </p>
                
                <h3> How this relates and how I will learn it </h3>
                <p> Best way to leanr this is to go back and look at the resource from previous classes and relearn the information on footers. Use the resources available to me to get the correct way to spacing the element out. </p>

				<h2> Background </h2>
                <div class="image">
                <a href="components/Multiple Pic Backgrounds.png">
                <img src="components/Multiple Pic Backgrounds.png"
                alt="background" height="900" width="900" />
                </a>
                </div>
                
                <h3> What I hope to Learn </h3>
                <p> So Background images are probably the easist thing when it comes to css but I havent truly thought of having multiple pics as my background at the same time. Having a collage as my background seems like a good concept to learn. Having a single multi picture background whould be a very useful tool. </p>
                
                <h3> How this relates and how I will learn it </h3>
                <p> Best way to leanr this is to go back and look at the resource from previous classes and relearn the information on multiple images. I feel like at some point I knew how to do this but time has made me forget the best way to do this. Now i plan to use Lynda.com to find the best solution. </p>

				<h2> Side Menu </h2>
                <div class="image">
                <a href="components/Side Menu.png">
                <img src="components/Side Menu.png"
                alt="Sidemenu" height="900" width="900" />
                </a>
                </div>
                
                <h3> What I hope to Learn </h3>
                <p> Now the side menu is something that i feel like isnt hard to learn. What i want to know though is how to get it to drop down when i click on it. </p>
                
                <h3> How this relates and how I will learn it </h3>
                <p> Drop down side menus are paramount for mobile websites and applications. The main thing is to figure out how to get it to work. Now i will use any and all resources I can to learn how to do it using lynda.com </p>
